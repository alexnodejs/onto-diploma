/*
i. Subsumption (Generalization) – a triangular ar
row
ii. Meronymy (part-whole) – a diamond (black or white)
1. Black is for aggregation (all possible parts belong to the same class)
2. White is for composition (different parts of the same whole may have different sense – like Tail and Leg in my example below)
iii. Association (all the rest between a class and a class) – solid line
iiii. Instanciation – (an object is the instance of a class) – a dashed line
